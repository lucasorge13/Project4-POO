The objective of this exercise is to reconstruct/unzip a message archived with a binary-tree-
based algorithm. The program should ask for a single filename at the start: "Please
enter filename to decode: ", decode the message in the file and print it out to the
console. The name of the compressed message file will end in .arch, e.g. “monalisa.arch”.
The file consists of two or three lines: the first one or two lines contain the encoding
scheme, and the second or third line contains the archived message.
